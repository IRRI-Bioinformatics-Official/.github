## Introduction
The **Bioinformatics Team** at the *International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)* is dedicated to advancing rice research through the application of computational biology, data analysis, and genomic technologies.

Our team develops and applies cutting-edge **bioinformatics tools** to analyze large-scale genomic and phenotypic data, supporting the improvement of rice varieties for:
- Higher yield
- Disease resistance
- Climate resilience

By integrating **genomics**, **machine learning**, and **advanced data analytics**, we contribute to:
- **Sustainable agricultural practices**
- **Global food security**

Join us as we **innovate** and **collaborate** in the world of rice research and breeding!
